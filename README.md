📊 Dataset
This dataset was originally from Kaggle - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques. It contains information on house sales in Ames, Iowa.

Target variable: SalePrice
Features used in model:

GrLivArea: Above ground living area (in square feet)

BedroomAbvGr: Number of bedrooms above ground

FullBath: Number of full bathrooms above ground

You can find detailed descriptions of all the features in data_description.txt.

⚙️ Model and Approach
We used a Linear Regression model from scikit-learn for predicting house prices.

Workflow:
Load and preprocess the data.

Select relevant features.

Handle missing values (drop rows with nulls).

Split data into train and test sets.

Train a linear regression model.

Evaluate model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.

Predict the price of a new house (for demo purposes).

📈 Sample Output
After training the model, the script prints:

Training MSE: 1402059616.12
Test MSE: 1603942893.83
Training R2: 0.718
Test R2: 0.688
Predicted price for the new house: $337241.52
▶️ How to Run
Make sure you have Python and required libraries installed. Then run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas scikit-learn
python app.py
🔮 Future Improvements
Use more features for better predictions

Try advanced models like XGBoost or Random Forest

Add a web interface using Flask or Streamlit

Feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning
